## Bird Classifier

A sort of attempt to learn Convolutional Neural Networks.

- Heroku deployment: [Bird Classifier](https://birdcalls.herokuapp.com/)

- Data acquisition, preparation and CNN: [Bird Classifier repo](https://github.com/Xavier4t/Bird-Classifier)


Note: While running the flask application in local, the bird marker and tooltips show the right bird selected and its location, somehow heroku randomly places the markers and birds in the map.
